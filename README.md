# Super-store-ship-mode-churn-prediction-model
ship mode churn prediction using CHAID decision tree in IBM SPSS Modeler


Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing the shipment behavior of customers using the Sample Superstore dataset. The primary objective is to understand how different factors — such as customer segment, region, category, and order priority — influence the mode of shipment. Using IBM SPSS Modeler, a CHAID (Chi-squared Automatic Interaction Detection) model is built to classify and predict the most likely shipping method chosen by customers.


Problem Statement

The project aims to analyze product shipment patterns to predict the ship mode used by customers. Using IBM SPSS Modeler, a CHAID classification model is developed to identify key factors influencing shipping decisions. Here, “Second Class” shipments are considered potential churn cases due to delayed or unsatisfactory delivery experiences. The goal is to help the business improve logistics efficiency and reduce churn by optimizing shipping strategies.

Conclusion

The CHAID model successfully identified the major factors affecting shipment mode selection, such as region, customer segment, and order priority. Insights revealed that delays and medium-priority orders are closely linked with Second Class (churn-prone) shipments. By focusing on improving delivery time and prioritizing high-risk segments, the company can enhance customer satisfaction and reduce potential shipment churn.
